# Portfolio
This project entailed building a working portfolio page from scratch. 
The page will have an About Me section, Contact Info section, and be able to scroll to those sections when clicked on the Nav Bar.
The page will scale appropriately when the screen size is adjusted and still be readable and functional, and the image of the project will contain a working link to take you to another site. 
In all honesty I'm aware that all of the criteria were not met on my portfolio page, however I tried to meet as many as I could while trying to at least upload the project on time.
Here is the link to the URL: https://duhl91.github.io/Portfolio/
